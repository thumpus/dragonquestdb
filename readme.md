DRAGON QUEST DB!
(Currently defunct) DEPLOYED AT: https://dragonquestdb.vercel.app/

(This is the repository for the frontend. The backend is at https://github.com/thumpus/dragonquestdbbackend)

This app is a database of information from the 1986 NES game, Dragon Quest (known as Dragon Warrior in the United States).

Utilizes a custom API to communicate with the backend and retrieve info from the database.

Also includes VENTURE FORTH, a barebones clicker minigame in which the user can wail on defenseless monsters to climb the leaderboard. 
This battle system replicates the methods and math from the original game, calculating damage numbers based on player level and equipped
weapon against the monster's defense. 

Created using Node.js, Express, and React. Utilizes jsonwebtoken and bcrypt for user authentication.
